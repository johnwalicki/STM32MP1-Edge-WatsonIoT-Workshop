# STM32MP1-Edge-WatsonIoT-Workshop
STMicroelectronics STM32MP1 Discovery Kit and IBM Edge / Watson Hands-On Workshop

## STM32MP1 Discovery Kit and IBM Edge / Watson Hands-On Workshop

Learn how to connect your next IoT Edge design to the Cloud using IBM Watson IoT Platform and the STM32MP1 Discovery Kit.  The STM32MP1 features a Cortex A7 multiprocessor and a ultra-low-power STM32L4 Cortex® -M4 MCU and wireless connectivity. In this workshop we will attach an IKS01A2 sensor expansion board to showcase cloud connectivity features.  By running OpenSTLinux on the A7 processor, we will run Node.js and Node-RED on the Edge device.  The program will send sensor data to the IBM Watson IoT Platform, where Node-RED running in a Node web application in IBM Cloud will display a Dashboard.  The data will be saved to a Cloudant time series database.  We will then use Watson Studio, IBM's data science portal, to create a machine learning model by ingesting the temperature / humidity sensor data. The model parameters will be sent from IBM Cloud to the STM32MP1 edge device.  Node-RED running local on the device will then score the incoming data and detect when you place your finger on the sensor.

**Presenters:** STMicroelectronics team with **John Walicki**, IBM Developer Advocate, CTO IoT Advocacy

This hands-on workshop will show you how to integrate sensors, wireless connectivity, a multiprocessor edge device, a low-power microcontroller and sensor libraries into your next IoT Edge design. You’ll then learn to connect the Discovery Kit to IBM Cloud and Watson IoT Platform to create a new application in minutes using Node-RED.  Watson Studio will create a machine learning model.  This model will be deployed to the edge.

The hands-on training is a working session – please bring your laptop. Note: Administrator rights is needed for software and driver installation. ST will provide the required STM32 development boards and software. SPACE IS LIMITED FOR THIS SESSION – FIRST COME, FIRST SEATED.

**The STM32MP1 Discovery kits must be returned after the session.**
